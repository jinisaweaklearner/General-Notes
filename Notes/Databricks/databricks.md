# Data Lineage
- Table Lineage & Column Lineage; know the downstream and upstream dependencies
- Explainability - we need to have the means of tracing features used in machine learning to the raw data that created those features,
- Tracing missing values in a dashboard or ML model to the origin,
- Finding specific data - organizations have hundreds and even thousands of data tables and sources. Finiding the table or column that contains specific information can be daunting without a proper discoverability tools.
